# Medieval Run

## Introduction
Welcome to Medieval Run, an exciting endless running game set in a medieval theme! I am thrilled to present this personal project that I am working on. In this game, players will embark on an epic adventure where they must navigate through random dungeon corridors and collect intriguing items while running endlessly.

## Objective
The main objective of Medieval Run is to create an engaging gameplay experience that will keep players hooked. As the player runs endlessly, they must gather various items scattered throughout the medieval landscape. However, they must also be cautious as collisions with obstacles can cause the player to lose health points (HP). The challenge lies in maintaining a high score while preserving HP to keep the game going. 


## Platforms
Medieval Run aims to reach a wide audience by being available on both PC and Android devices. Whether you prefer to play on your computer or take the adventure on the go with your mobile phone, the game will be with you.


## Technologies Used
To bring Medieval Run to life, the following tools and technologies are being utilized:
- **Game Engine**: Unity
- **Programming Language**: C# (for Scripts)
- **Assets**: Mixamo for animations and Unity Asset Store for all the other assets 
- **Version Control**: Git


## Getting Started
To try out Medieval Run on your PC, follow these steps:
1. Download the project ZIP file by clicking on the "Download ZIP" button on the GitHub repository page.
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder on your computer.
3. (testing...)


## Future Enhancements
While the core gameplay of Medieval Run is the endless running concept with collectibles and obstacles, I have some plans to expand and enhance the game. Some potential features and improvements include:
- Finish the main scenario and obstacles
- Implement a Main Menu and Pause scenes
- More collectables that will temporaly change the velocity of player.
- Different playable characters with unique attributes.
- Additional levels or environments to explore within the medieval dungeon.
- Integration of leaderboard and achievements to add a competitive element.
- Refinements to graphics, sound effects, and overall user experience based on player feedback.
